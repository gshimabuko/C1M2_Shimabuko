 # @brief   Repository for second assignment of Introduction to Embedded Systems
 #          Software and Development Environments:
 #
 # @details This project consisted on the implementation of a makefile that would
 #          receive the platform as a parameter and perform the appropriate
 #          compilation if platform was host or MSP432 ARM.
